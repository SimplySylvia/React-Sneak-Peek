# React Sneak Peak

### What is a Frontend Framework? 

- A framework is software providing generic functionality and structure that serves as foundation to build and deploy applications.
- Express is a framework that runs on the server, receiving incoming request from the client, preforming some work that you have defined, and returning some response to the client.  Front-end frameworks run in the client's browser, receive input from interactions with the page, perform some work that you have defined, and make any updates necessary.
- Frameworks can help standardize code, give you additional functionality and performance, and can help get your code off the ground faster.  
- There are [many](https://stateofjs.com/2017/front-end/) front end frameworks and each go about solving problems of how state is managed, updated, and represented by a view but there are many commonalities.
- There is a lot of debate over whether frontend frameworks count as frameworks at all -- some people say that they are just libraries and should be referred to as such.

### What is ReactJS?

React is a JavaScript library used to craft modern day UI and views for the front-end in web applications.

> **Selling Point:** By modeling small compatible components that focus on just rendering a view, we can move business logic out of the DOM, and therefore improve our app's performance, maintainability, modularity and readability.

#### Some History

The first thing most people hear about React is "Facebook uses it."
* First used by Facebook in 2011.
* Then Instagram in 2012.
* Went open source in May 2013.

React was born out of Facebook's frustration with the traditional MVC model and how..
  * Re-rendering something meant re-rendering everything (or just a lot).
  * That had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.

### React in MVC

React can be thought of as the "Views" layer.

React will work with any back-end language, but for project 3 and in our in-class examples we will be using Mongoose and Express for the models and controllers.

  The visual template the user sees, often populated with data from our models.

### React has 4 main features.

- Components
- JSX
- State
- Props


## Components

One comment made about React when it was first open sourced was "Rethinking established best practices" which kind of became the React motto.  In React, we want to move away from template pages, away from separating code based purely on file type, and more towards a **component-based** separation of concerns.

## JSX

JSX (JavaScript eXtension) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax. Similar in appearance to HTML, JSX provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. React components are typically written using JSX, although they do not have to be (components may also be written in pure JavaScript). JSX is similar to another extension syntax created by Facebook for PHP, XHP.

**Standard HTML**

```html
<div>
  <p>Header</p>
  <p>Content</p>
  <p>Footer</p>
</div>
```
**JSX Example**

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Header</p>
        <p>Content</p>
        <p>Footer</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```
